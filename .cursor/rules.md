# Project Rules (Short)

1. Any change starts with spec in `docs/specs/`.
2. Code changes must include tests.
3. Small commits only (one logical change).
4. Update `docs/CHANGELOG.md` after every meaningful change.
5. Follow workflow described in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
6. MCP usage policy is defined in `docs/MCP.md`.
7. Testing standards are defined in `docs/TESTING.md`.
8. If unsure — stop and clarify via spec.
